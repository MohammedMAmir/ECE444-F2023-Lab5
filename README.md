#### Pros and Cons of TDD

Test-Driven Design (TDD) provides an iterative way to develop and test code as a project progresses. Not only does it make the testing of a software project much simpler, providing a set a of concrete cases to pass before development even begins, but it also makes development easier. Developers have a concrete understanding of the features and properties that the software should exhibit as they write it and these features can be expanded upon as they move along. In this way, TDD helps shape the design of the project as it moves along.

The drawbacks of TDD lie in how it can narrow the overall design and success of a piece of software to a given set of tests. TDD can cause an overreliance on automated testing to measure the effectiveness of a design and even though the tests may overlook a specific aspect of the design. Things like how readable the code is, how efficient it is, whether it can handle edge cases, are all things that may not be tested and may be overlooked when simply looking at how the design measures up against the initial tests. Furthermore, aspects of design like usability, user satisfaction, and scalability are difficult to test with just automated testing. In these case TDD is insufficient in testing the full implementation of the design by taking these factors into account.
